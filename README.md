# QL-Based Adaptive MAC Protocol

This project explores a Reinforcement Learning-based Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol using Q-learning. The aim is to optimize wireless communication by enabling nodes to adaptively learn efficient channel access strategies under dynamic traffic conditions.  

## Overview

Traditional MAC protocols often rely on fixed rules or schedules for channel access, which can lead to inefficiencies under varying network loads. This project leverages Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, combined with SimPy, a discrete-event simulation framework, to model and optimize the system's behavior.  

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements Q-learning to optimize channel access decisions.
- **Dynamic Traffic Adaptation**: Simulates real-world traffic patterns and adaptive learning.
- **Performance Metrics**: Enhances throughput and reduces latency with optimized strategies.
- **Simulation Framework**: Uses SimPy for accurate modeling of wireless communication events.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **SimPy**: Framework for discrete-event simulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing simulation results.
